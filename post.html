            <p>Those who fall in this category staunchly believe that we must be prepared for the advent of quantum computing as an imminent threat and must be dealt with as <a href=”blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/quantum-c
            omputing-must-be-a-national-security-priority/” targe=”_blank”>swiftly as possible</a>. If enough of a commotion is made, governments must take notice, and many will likely heed the call to ensure that data remains secure. Further, governments have their own interests to protect, as all governments (hopefully) use encryption to send and store confidential information. <br><br> On top of all of this, secure government files, credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc. sent over the internet today can be saved and decrypted 25 years from now. People who hold this view consider nearly every potential piece of data that is unsecure a piece of data worth being concerned about. Which is why they believe encryptions must be updated as soon as possible, because the longer we wait to do so, the more data is put at risk.

          <div class="content">
            <p>Those who hold this view do not believe it is a big deal if a few algorithms securing less important information don’t get updated. Even today, some encryption schemes that are considered breakable by the latest technology (i.e. RSA 512) are still in <a href=”www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/quantum-computing-and-its-
              Impact-on-cryptography” target=”_blank”>minimal use</a>. A minority of encryptions still use these outdated technologies - and data breaches are still relatively uncommon. One could argue that the difference between a state-of-the art encryption algorithm that is quantum susceptible and an encryption algorithm that is outdated today are different in that the technology to break these encryptions aren’t widespread. However, there’s no reason to believe quantum computers capable of breaking modern encryption standards will be commercially available anytime soon. <br><br>The estimate of 25 years is only until the first production of a quantum computer - which is worrying, but it will likely take even longer for such a device to land in the hands of a person with malicious intent. Obviously, the ideal is to update all encryption schemes before such a device exists at all, but if companies such as IBM or Google have one - is it really all that worrisome?  Those who hold this view believe that all highly sensitive data will be secure enough within 25 years, and an encryption crisis will not occur, because all data that needs to be secure will be.
              <br><br>Those who hold this view point out that mathematicians and scientists <a href=”https://www.nature.com/articles/543171a” target=”_blank”>have already developed</a> (and are still developing) quantum-resistant algorithms. Therefore, as long as these algorithms are implemented in a timely fashion (within 25 years), highly sensitive data should remain secure. Further, estimates of phasing out encryption algorithms, using evidence from past endeavors, hover around 10 years, allowing this endeavor to be <a href=”https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/25/implications-of-quantum-comp
              Uting-for-encryption-policy-pub-78985” target=”_blank”>entirely plausible</a> within the time frame.According to this perspective, in 25 years, most data will be secure - at least secure enough that there is not much to worry about.

              Perspective 3
            </h2>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">"While it does seem logical that the shift would occur naturally, many encryption algorithms are buried deep inside existing programs, and it is unlikely they would be updated without nudging."</blockquote>
          </div> 
          <div class="content">
            <p>A lot of effort and money is required to update the existing algorithms. Further, the widespread knowledge of this issue in academia has resulted in a large number of individuals (mathematicians, computer scientists, etc.) working to solve it, so the general public may have little to worry about. <br><br> Those who support this view believe companies do not have sufficient motivation to update their algorithms. The believe companies can only lose the public’s trust if the public is actively aware of the issue. This is why awareness amongst the general public is key to the successful migration of encryptions schemes to quantum resistivity. By ensuring a continued awareness of the issues quantum computers pose to the security of the world’s data, the public can force companies to upgrade simply by voicing their concerns. As proof, those who hold this view point to how since the public has been vocal about such concerns, IBM has offered access to “quantum-safe” cryptographic services on its public cloud <a target=”_blank” href=”https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/security/why-it-s-good-idea-start-thinking-about-quantum-safe-cryptography-now”>by 2020</a>. <br><br> Further, by teaching the public to be more conscious about safe internet practices, general awareness of security issues will be more prominent, granting this issue enough of a presence such that it demands action on it’s own. A large portion of security issues actually <a href=”https://www.americanscientist.org/article/is-quan
            Tum-computing-a-cybersecurity-threat” target=”_blank”>do not come from encryption issues</a>, but users being tricked into scams, or data leaks from the inside. As long as users are being conscious of avoiding scams, they will have a heightened awareness of security issues, granting cryptographic concerns a greater presence in the world.
